Hello and thank you for your interest in Wikimedia and for the question you just sent us via the contact form.

We will get in touch soon. There are times when we receive a lot of enquiries, primarily during the months of November and December, when we are running the Wikimedia donation campaign. Therefore, we may need a bit of time to look into your enquiry. But even if sometimes it takes us a little longer to reply, please be assured that we will get back to you. None of the enquiries we receive get lost.

We wish you a pleasant {$ day_of_the_week $}.

With best wishes from Berlin,

Your Wikimedia Donation Service
