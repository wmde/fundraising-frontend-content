Years later, I discovered the weightless online encyclopedia Wikipedia – a totally addictive source of knowledge. Searching for term A leads me to another term B via a link and on to the next term C via another link (this used to be called the \"Brockhaus effect\", describing what an encylopedia does to its users). At the end of the search, the user is wrapped in a cloud of insights - about a person, a historic event, and so on. Never before has this been as easy, quick and comfortable - it is just like using a Nuremberg funnel. Wikipedia is for flexible curious minds with a thirst for knowledge. Now dust is gathering on the gilt edges of my encyclopediæ, which is only disturbed once or twice a year when I look something up in the bound volumes."

In some articles, the pages with discussions and different versions are full of rich material for a critical evaluation of the article topics, and sometimes also for one's own social studies. A democratic, freely accessible knowledge database that will hopefully continue to receive a steady influx of articles, also including contributions by new experts who join the community. Fantastic! Absolutely essential! Deserves all the support it can get!"
