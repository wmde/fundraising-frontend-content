You will be invited to events, and on request, you will receive information about the association and from the association.</p><p>Active members additionally support the association with active participation. They are the heart of Wikimedia Deutschland and have all the statutory rights and obligations. In particular, this includes the right to submit proposals to the board and at members' meetings, the active and passive voting right and the right to vote and to speak at members' meetings. Active members organise and shape the events and the work of the association Wikimedia Deutschland.

Wikipedia is not funded through advertising; an objective encyclopedia would lose its credibility if it did that.

In addition, Wikimedia is represented in approximately 40 countries to promote free knowledge locally. In Germany, the organisation is represented through the association Wikimedia Deutschland e. V.

This determines the budget needed for next year and the proceeds that are required from donations (and in the case of WMDE, from membership fees) which form a major part of the budget.

The idea was for Wikipedia to become an encyclopedia where everybody can participate. This particularly applies to the joint editing of content, which is only possible if knowledge is made available for free. Knowledge is truly free when it is freely accessible and usable for all human beings. All Wikipedia content can be freely reused by everybody without infringing copyright or having to pay fees. This is how volunteer authors share their knowledge in Wikipedia, turning the free online encyclopedia into one of the most important sources of information. Knowledge from the other Wikimedia projects is also available to all – for example in the form of photos and videos from the free media archive Wikimedia Commons.</p><p>As an association to promote free knowledge, we are working on making sure that projects such as Wikipedia can continue to exist in the future and that Free Knowledge becomes a matter of course in our society.</p>",
