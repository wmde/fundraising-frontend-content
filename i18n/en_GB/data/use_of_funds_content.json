Because compared to other top websites, we only need an extraordinarily small budget to cover our running costs and for investments into the future. The only reason why this is possible is because Wikipedia does not pursue a “business model”, all contributions to Wikipedia are written by volunteers and we only have around 900 members of staff worldwide. In addition, we are a non-profit organization, which obliges us to handle our revenue responsibly and efficiently."
