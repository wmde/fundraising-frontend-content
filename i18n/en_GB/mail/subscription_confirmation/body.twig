Excellent â€“we now have everything we need. Thank you for your confirmation.

What happens next? As you may know, we run our Wikipedia donation campaign once a year. This campaign always has a fundraising target that we try to achieve through calls for donations. As soon as we have achieved the target, the campaign ends. Therefore, we rely on the donations of the Wikipedia readers during that time, since Wikipedia is not funded through advertising or data harvesting, but through the voluntary commitment of its users.

We will let you know when the donation campaign starts. Until then, please enjoy our free knowledge projects, gaining knowledge along the way.

Bye for now and best wishes from Berlin,
