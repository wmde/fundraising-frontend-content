Fantastic – you want to become a member of Wikimedia Deutschland e. V.
I am pleased that you have decided to provide lasting support to the dissemination of free knowledge as a {$ membership_type $}.

What happens next? First, you will receive our welcome package {$ incentive $}by post to let you know that your membership has officially started. The welcome letter also gives you a transparent overview of all the information you need about your membership. However, since we send the welcome letter in bulk, please bear with us and give us a bit of time. Normally, your first membership fee is debited a few weeks later. You have selected the amount of {$ formatted_amount $} as your membership fee. This is the amount to be debited {$ donation_interval $}. Before we debit the amount for the first time, you will of course receive an advance notification of your SEPA direct debit mandate, which also includes our mandate reference number. 

Once your membership has started, we would like to get in touch with you to draw your attention to interesting events, project news or other important events in the context of free knowledge.
