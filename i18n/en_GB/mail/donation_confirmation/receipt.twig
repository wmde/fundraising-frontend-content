If you would like to deduct your {$ pluralize(donation_interval, 'donations', 'donations', 'donation') $} from tax, you can already download the simplified donation receipt here (https://spenden.wikimedia.de/resources/de_DE/Vereinfachter_Zuwendungsbescheid_Wikimedia_Spenden.pdf). If your donation does not exceed the amount of EUR 300, you can submit this donation receipt together with {$ pluralize(donation_interval, 'your bank statement', 'your bank statements', 'your bank statement') $} to your tax office. You can also wait until March of the following year, when we automatically send a collective donation receipt for all amounts of EUR 5 and above to your postal address.
