As requested by you, we have cancelled your membership application (No. {$ application_id $}).

It would help us enormously to find out why you have cancelled. Was there a problem with the form, or do you have any additional questions about the membership? Or about Wikimedia? Whatever it was, we would like to know about it to correct any errors. Therefore, we are looking forward to an email to mitglieder@wikimedia.de or a call to (030) 577 11 62-19.

Thank you for your assistance.

Kind regards,
