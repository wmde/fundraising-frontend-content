We have received your message.

We will get in touch soon. Please note that there are times when we receive a lot of enquiries, primarily during the months of November and December, when we are running the Wikimedia donation campaign. Therefore, we may need a bit of time to look into your enquiry. But even if sometimes it takes us a little longer to reply, please be assured that we will get back to you. None of the enquiries we receive get lost.
